                "text": "The goal of this study is to understand whether or not children are sensitive to how things change over time. \n\nDuring the game you and your child played, the first three trials showed flowers blooming in three different ways. Some started off small and steadily got bigger over time (linear function), some started off fully in bloom, got smaller and returned to being in full bloom (quadratic function), and some went back and forth from being in full bloom to becoming small and returning to full bloom a few times (periodic function). \n\nIn the last three trials, instead of watching movies of flowers blooming over time, we instead showed still images of how flowers bloomed over the course of a week. These flowers changed in three different ways: one started off in full bloom and steadily got smaller over time (linear decrease), one started off small and got suddenly bigger and then got suddenly bigger again (stepwise function), and one started off really small and quickly became bigger and bigger (exponential function). \n\nWhy is this important? \n\nIf even young children can generate descriptions on their own of these different functions, this suggests that they have very abstract representations that might help them categorize and infer causal relationships across superficially dissimilar kinds of events. In much the same way, scientists can use abstract functions like these to represent all kinds of different phenomena— from changes in the economy to changes in the population of migratory birds to changes in rainfall. \n\nThank you so much for participating!
